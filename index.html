    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
      attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[- The best way to give advice to a client is to first inform about security, what it means,
      what damage It can make, and how easy it can be avoided. Depends on the client on what them want and what they need.
      Like Noroff, OneLogin is a great authorization of the student for example, OneLogin is a third-party client, where it
      makes easier for the website to make sure it is safe. For a website that use a lot of links, sanitization of
      data would be recommended there. Or you could get a third party, that ensure the security for the company. The last
      thing would be to recommend CI/CD configuration, where it is most common in many places to check that one is not a
      robot, where you can make sure it is secure. Many have also different security combined, that make it more secure. For
      each day, the system gets more advance, and the security get more difficult to have control on. So, itâ€™s important
      to have a plan early, so that one is ready for what is to come or for unexpected breaches.
      With good security, comes customers. To have a proper way of authorization or other clients that gives security, means
      that the customer feels safer, and when it feel safe the more traffic (customers) it also come with it.
